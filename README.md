# Pareto Chart 4.0

**Pareto Chart 4.0** is an interactive application developed with **Streamlit** that generates Pareto charts from Excel files. Its main goal is to help visualize the main causes impacting processes, highlighting the causes that represent 80% of the total impact through a shaded area in the chart called the "Pay Attention Zone."

## Features

- Educational synopsis of the traditional use of Pareto and the opportunities that a small contribution can generate.
- Automatic generation of Pareto charts from Excel files.
- Visual identification of the 80% of the main causes in the chart.
- Download of the generated charts in PDF format.
- Simple and quick functionality for work teams in continuous improvement, production, and maintenance areas.

## Instructions for Use

1. **Upload an Excel file**: The file must have two columns:
   - **First column**: The causes (e.g., Failures, Delays, Opportunities, etc.).
   - **Second column**: The frequency or impact of each cause (e.g., Accumulated time or number of events).
2. **Visualize the chart**: The application will automatically sort the events by severity and generate the Pareto chart, highlighting the "Pay Attention Zone" (shaded area corresponding to 80% of the stops).
3. **Download the chart**: You can download the generated chart in PDF format for further analysis.

## Innovation

The phrase attributed to E. Murphy, "Nothing is so bad that it can't get worse," condenses many statistical and probabilistic principles for us mere mortals to understand. After many years of professional practice, we are convinced of the importance of studying and understanding the fundamentals, and then venturing down the path of discovery. This was largely what happened with this project: it seems we pulled a thread from a hand-knit sweater. From a simple Pareto chart, other insights have emerged that we are developing, and through this app, we will share them with all of you.

If the first phrase is valid and largely indisputable, its same logic leads us to deduce that "Nothing is so good that it can't be improved." That thought motivates us to tirelessly seek innovation, even in the most traditional corners. We will see where this unexpected loose thread takes us...
